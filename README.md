* **Project 1: Data Modeling with Postgres** [Details](https://github.com/cc59chong/Data-Modeling-with-Postgres) <br>
 > This project builds a star schema in Postgres with fact and dimension tables for analytics. A Python ETL pipeline transfers data from local JSON files into these tables.
Apache Cassandra exercises: create tables, primary key, clustering column, where clause
* **Project 2: Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra** [Details](https://github.com/cc59chong/Data-Modeling-with-Apache-Cassandra) <br>
 > This project involves designing and implementing an ETL pipeline to analyze music streaming data using Apache Cassandra. The goal is to transform raw event data stored in CSV files into a structured database optimized for specific query patterns.
